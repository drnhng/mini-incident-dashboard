## ðŸ›  Approach

First, I set up the GraphQL backend using Express and Apollo Server, and created mock data based on the sample provided so I could test the frontend. With GraphQL Code Generator, I was able to generate types which i put in the /types folder.

Then, I created an MVP version of the frontend with just the incident feed and a button to add a new incident. I created my own custom React hooks in the /hooks folder for the GraphQL queries and mutations, and connected them to the frontend components. This allows the query/mutation logic to be abstracted and made reusable.

Once I verified the hooks were working correctly, I implemented the remaining functionality: filtering, deleting, and editing incidents. I decided to allow the user to select multiple incidents for the purpose of batch deleting incidents.

I used a ContextProvider to manage UI-related state, such as which modals are open, which incident is selected, and what filters are applied.

Finally, I added a reusable pagination component to allow for browsing incidents in pages of 5.
