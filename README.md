## 🛠 Approach

First, I set up the GraphQL backend using Express and Apollo Server, and created mock data based on the sample provided so I could test the frontend. With GraphQL Code Generator, I was able to generate types which i put in the /types folder.

In my frontend design, I made sure to create reusable UI components to avoid code duplication and maintain clean code throughout. The stylesheets for each component are organized into the /styles folder.

I started by creating just the incident feed and a button to add a new incident. I created my own custom React hooks in the /hooks folder for the GraphQL queries and mutations, and connected them to the frontend components. This allowed the query/mutation logic to be abstracted and made reusable.

Once I verified the hooks were properly set up, I implemented the remaining functionality: filtering, deleting, and editing incidents. I decided to allow the user to select multiple incidents for the purpose of batch deleting incidents.

I used a ContextProvider to avoid prop drilling and manage UI states such as selected incidents and filters.

Finally, I implemented a reusable pagination component to allow for browsing incidents in pages of 5.
